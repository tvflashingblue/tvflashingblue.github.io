it unravels in goes, and seconds and goes\
from under your hand like half of a home-\
thinning and laid out in rows.\
'you sun, and i centre', (you yes and i no)





and when circled in air or told like a joke,\
near any transgression shifts weight 
to the Tome.\
like things you won't tell that everyone knows:\
they let you stay quiet, to keep you so close.
