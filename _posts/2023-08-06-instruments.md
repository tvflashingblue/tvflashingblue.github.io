a young girl is looking through you,\
and she is asking you to follow her.\
today isn’t the day, of course!\
but you will see her again and again until you have no choice but to go.\
for now, you mask it with a rage to live, it is proof of being.



when the door opens you will be reborn in white heat,\
free from your thankless captor.\
you’ll slip out quietly from the graceless, painful routine,\
the face that you grew into,\
the cruelty of bodies.\
and when she sees you she’ll say,\
“go on now, the phone is ringing!”
