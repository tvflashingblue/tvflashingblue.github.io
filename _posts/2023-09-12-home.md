i don’t know a thing about you, isn’t that strange?\
sometimes i wonder where i’ve been,\
deep in insular, witless youth,\
the great unlistening



i don’t know a thing about you but\
weather permitting,\
peace attending,\
i will find myself home again at the table\
watching you laughing like you know better
