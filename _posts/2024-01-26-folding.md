stone figure in motion, twisting;\
you look like you could fold onto flat ground\
and be caught, ripened, centred.




it had been of no concern to me until i was borrowed by a god\
and returned as only half a man.\
now, when i reach to you\
i leave some of my pieces in that dark,\
and my hands and flesh are emptied.
