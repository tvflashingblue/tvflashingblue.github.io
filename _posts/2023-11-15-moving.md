you call me while driving,\
asking do i want the peanut sauce or the other one? the other one.\
i'm not sure if you heard me.



you were looking at an accident, a car on its side,\
they're moving it now.\
you tell me you hope they survived,\
and for a second, i don't, for their sake.\
i don't tell you this. i don't know that i mean it anyway,\
as i move constantly between this disdain\
and a separate, burning desire to live and keep on living,\
possibly until it's only me.



you're breaking up now,\
but there was something i was meant to ask you.\
i don't remember what it was, but there was something.
